# Wudo Drupal starter

Drupal 11 starter project containing the site dependencies, custom theme,
custom module, and project recipes in one repository. The project uses
`web/` as its document root.

## Repository layout

- `web/` is the Drupal document root.
- `web/themes/custom/wudo/` contains the custom theme and its component source.
- `web/modules/custom/wudo_theme_extension/` contains custom Drupal behavior and API endpoints.
- `recipes/` contains the content recipes applied during installation.
- `config/sync/` contains exported Drupal configuration tracked in Git.
- `vendor/` and frontend dependencies are generated locally and are not committed.

Contributed extensions are managed by Composer. Custom extensions and recipes
are committed directly in this repository.

## Quick start

Requires [DDEV](https://ddev.com). Everything else, including Composer and
Node.js, runs inside the containers.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wunderio/wudo_starter.git && cd wudo_starter
ddev start
ddev site-install
```

`ddev site-install` installs the Composer and npm dependencies, builds the
theme, installs Drupal from the configuration in `config/sync/`, creates the
home page and the error pages, builds the XML sitemap and prints a one-time
login link. Add `--demo` to install the demo
content (articles, a gallery and landing pages) instead of the bare home page:

```bash
ddev site-install --demo
```

Running the command on an existing site reinstalls it; Drush asks before
dropping the database.

## Installing without DDEV

Create `web/sites/default/settings.local.php` with the database connection
(see `web/sites/example.settings.local.php`), set the `DRUPAL_HASH_SALT`
environment variable, then run from the project root:

```bash
composer install
(cd web/themes/custom/wudo && npm ci && npm run build)
vendor/bin/drush site:install --existing-config
vendor/bin/drush recipe ../recipes/error_pages
vendor/bin/drush recipe ../recipes/base_content
vendor/bin/drush xmlsitemap:rebuild
```

Use `../recipes/demo` in place of `../recipes/base_content` for the demo
content.

## Configuration

`config/sync/` is the single source of truth for site configuration, and the
site is installed from it. Export after making intentional changes and import
when deploying:

```bash
ddev drush config:export
ddev drush config:import
```

## Roles

- **Administrator** builds the site: content types, views, modules, settings.
- **Content editor** (`content_editor`) runs it day to day: creates, edits and
  deletes every content type, uploads media, manages tags, menu links, URL
  aliases and redirects, and uses the rich text editor. It cannot reach
  people, modules, content types, views, appearance or site settings.

Give a client the content editor role. A browser test signs in as one, writes
an article and checks which admin pages open and which answer 403.

## Content recipes

- `recipes/error_pages` holds the "Page not found" and "Access denied" pages
  and is always applied.
- `recipes/base_content` holds the home page. The front page setting points to
  its `/home` alias.
- `recipes/demo` holds the demo content, including its own `/home` page.

Apply only one of the last two to a site. To update a recipe from a running site,
export the entities with their dependencies:

```bash
ddev drush content:export node --with-dependencies --dir=../recipes/demo/content
ddev drush content:export menu_link_content --dir=../recipes/demo/content
```

The `wudo_theme_extension` module makes paragraphs and hand-set URL aliases
part of the export; paragraphs are written inline in the entity that owns them.

## "Follow us" links

The footer has a "Follow us" block that lists the links of the "Social links"
menu as icons. Add the profiles at Structure → Menus → Social links
(`/admin/structure/menu/manage/social`): the link title is the name read by
screen readers, and the icon is picked from the address, so pasting
`https://www.instagram.com/yourname` is enough. The block is hidden while the
menu is empty.

Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon,
WhatsApp, Telegram, Pinterest and GitHub are recognised, as are `mailto:`
addresses and RSS feeds; anything else gets a globe. To add a network, put its
icon in the theme's `assets/icons` and its domain in
`wudo_preprocess_menu__social()` in `wudo.theme`.

## Adding a language

The starter ships with one language, English. To make the site multilingual,
run one command with the code of the language to add:

```bash
ddev add-language lv
```

It can be run again for every further language. The command:

- installs Content Translation and Configuration Translation;
- adds the language and downloads its interface translations;
- makes content, media, taxonomy terms, menu links, blocks and paragraphs
  translatable;
- places the language switcher in the header;
- makes the front page and error page aliases work in every language;
- adds an XML sitemap per language (`/lv/sitemap.xml`);
- exports the configuration, so the language is part of every later install.
  Review and commit the changes in `config/sync`.

URLs get a language prefix (`/en/...`, `/lv/...`) and `/` redirects to the
default language. Content stays in English until it is translated: an
untranslated page is not listed in the other language and its alias only
works under `/en`.

Without DDEV, run the steps yourself:

```bash
drush pm:install content_translation config_translation
drush language:add lv
drush wudo:multilingual
drush xmlsitemap:rebuild
drush config:export
```

## Adding projects

A portfolio of projects is optional. Add it with one command, on a fresh or a
running site:

```bash
ddev add-projects           # or: ddev add-projects --demo, with four examples
```

It applies the `recipes/projects` recipe, which adds:

- the "Project" content type, with the alias `/projects/<title>`;
- the "Project categories" and "Project statuses" vocabularies; the statuses
  come with "Concept", "In progress" and "Completed";
- the `/projects` list with a "Projects" link in the main menu, sorted by
  year and filtered by category and status;
- projects in the XML sitemap, and translatable projects on a multilingual
  site.

The configuration is exported afterwards, so projects are part of the site
from then on, including fresh installs.

### Fields or vocabularies

The rule the content type follows, and the one to keep when adapting it:

- a value that **repeats across projects and that visitors pick from** is a
  vocabulary: category, status. Add one for anything else to filter by, e.g.
  services, city or material;
- a value that **belongs to one project** is a field: location, area, year,
  client. Numbers are number fields, so that the list can be sorted by them.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Description | text | card text and meta description |
| Main image | media | card and top of the page |
| Category | "Project categories" terms | several allowed, filter |
| Status | "Project statuses" term | filter |
| Location | text | address or place |
| Area | whole number | the suffix "m²" is a field setting |
| Year, End year | whole numbers | shown as "2025–2026", list sorted by year |
| Client | text | |
| Body | formatted text | |
| Gallery | media | lightbox |

### Adapting it

Everything is done in the UI, without touching templates:

- rename, remove or add fields at Structure → Content types → Project. On the
  project page, every field enabled in "Manage display" becomes a row of the
  facts list, labelled with the name of the field, in the order set there.
  Only the main image, body and gallery have a fixed place;
- to filter by a new vocabulary, add a term reference field and expose it as a
  filter in the "Projects" view;
- filters of every view are shown by the `wudo:filter-bar` component: in the
  page on wide screens, in a drawer on narrow ones, with results updated in
  place. See `components/03-organisms/filter/README.md` in the theme;
- the page title block is shown on listed paths only; keep `/projects` and
  `/projects/*` on that list when changing the aliases.

## Adding cookie consent

A consent notice is optional; a site that sets no cookies beyond its own and
embeds nothing does not need one. Add it with one command:

```bash
ddev add-consent                 # consent notice, YouTube and Vimeo placeholders
ddev add-consent G-XXXXXXXXXX    # the same, plus Google Analytics 4
```

It downloads [Klaro!](https://www.drupal.org/project/klaro) (and
[Google Tag](https://www.drupal.org/project/google_tag) when a measurement ID
is given), applies `recipes/consent` or `recipes/consent_ga4`, and exports the
configuration. Commit `composer.json`, `composer.lock` and `config/sync`
afterwards.

What visitors get:

- a notice with equally prominent "Accept" and "Decline" buttons, and
  "Customize" to choose per service;
- a "Cookie settings" link in the footer menu to change the choice later;
- embedded YouTube and Vimeo videos replaced by a placeholder that loads the
  video on request.

Nothing is merely hidden: until the visitor agrees, the Google Analytics
script is in the page as inert `text/plain` and the browser neither runs it
nor contacts Google, and a video `iframe` has no `src`. The browser tests
check exactly that: no request to Google before consent or after declining,
requests after accepting, none again after withdrawing.

Things to do on a real site:

- set the privacy policy page at Configuration → Klaro! → Texts
  (`/admin/config/user-interface/klaro/texts`); it points to the front page
  until then;
- add other third parties as services at Configuration → Klaro!
  (`/admin/config/user-interface/klaro`), and allow their domains in the
  Content Security Policy. The recipe allows only what Google Analytics
  needs;
- services whose settings contain JavaScript code (Google's "consent mode"
  services, for example) do not run: the Content Security Policy does not
  allow evaluating strings as code. Blocking a script until consent, as done
  here, does not need any.

## Settings and secrets

`web/sites/default/settings.php` is tracked in Git and contains no credentials.
Database connections, API keys and other environment-specific values belong in
`settings.local.php`, which is ignored, or in environment variables. Never
commit credentials or production secrets.

The DDEV-generated `settings.ddev.php` is local-only. Its permissive
`trusted_host_patterns` setting is suitable for local development only; set
explicit host patterns before deploying to a shared or production environment.

## SEO and security defaults

- `metatag` provides titles, descriptions, canonical URLs and Open Graph tags.
- `xmlsitemap` serves `/sitemap.xml` for all three content types; the error
  pages and the front page node are left out.
- `redirect` keeps old URLs working when aliases change.
- `csp` enforces a Content Security Policy that allows scripts from the site
  itself only. Inline scripts and inline event handlers (`onclick="…"`) are
  blocked, so attach behavior from JavaScript files. Embeds are allowed from
  YouTube and Vimeo; add other sources at `/admin/config/system/csp`.
- `seckit` sends `Strict-Transport-Security` and `Referrer-Policy`.

## Quality checks

The same checks run in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every
pull request, together with a full `ddev site-install --demo` from scratch.

```bash
ddev exec vendor/bin/phpcs      # Drupal coding standards
ddev exec vendor/bin/phpstan    # static analysis
ddev exec vendor/bin/phpunit    # tests, on a throwaway SQLite database
ddev npm run lint:css           # run in web/themes/custom/wudo
ddev e2e                        # browser tests against the installed site
```

`ddev e2e` runs the Playwright tests in `tests/e2e` inside the web container;
the first run downloads Chromium. They cover every page in the XML sitemap:

- smoke checks: status codes, one `h1`, no JavaScript or CSP errors, social
  links;
- interactions: favorites drawer, favorites via `/api/favorites`, mobile menu,
  project filters (in place, by address and without JavaScript) when projects
  are installed;
- consent: nothing is loaded from Google before consent, when consent is
  installed;
- content editor: can write an article, cannot reach site building pages;
- accessibility: axe-core, WCAG 2.2 AA, on desktop and mobile viewports;
- Lighthouse: accessibility, best practices and SEO must score 100.

Arguments are passed to Playwright, e.g. `ddev e2e a11y --project=desktop`.
The HTML report, with Lighthouse reports attached, is written to
`tests/e2e/playwright-report`. Tests that need articles are skipped unless
the site was installed with `--demo`.

`vendor/bin/phpcbf` and `npm run lint:css -- --fix` fix most style issues
automatically.

## Component catalog

```bash
ddev storybook
```

builds a Storybook catalog of the theme's Single Directory Components and
prints its address. Every page is generated from the component's
`*.component.yml` and rendered with its own Twig template, CSS and JS, so a
new component shows up without writing a story. See
`web/themes/custom/wudo/docs/storybook.md`.

## Theme development

Run these commands from `web/themes/custom/wudo`:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run dev:sdc
```

Build production assets with `npm run build`. `node_modules/`, `dist/` and the
`.css` files compiled next to each component's `.scss` are ignored by Git and
recreated by the build, so run it after changing any `.scss` file.

### Twig template suggestions

Enable Drupal's local theme development mode to show Twig template filenames
and suggestions as HTML comments in the page source:

```bash
ddev drush theme:dev on
ddev drush cr
```

Open the page source in the browser and look for comments such as
`THEME DEBUG` and `THEME HOOK SUGGESTIONS`. Disable it before production:

```bash
ddev drush theme:dev off
ddev drush cr
```
